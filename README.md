## Installation

## Quickstart

pygameChart provides a simple use (similar to matplotlib) to create figure, set properties (like title, label names, chart limits etc.) and add several charts. In this phase it supports line plot, scatter plot and bar charts. Also in this phase, it accepts x and y axis data as two separate lists. I will add support for accepting different datatypes like dictionary numpy arrays or pandas series and dataframes.

Basic use of the package creates following result.
